					<a href="" data-title="Makima" data-image="img/makima-02.webp" data-description="(Japanese: マキマ) On the surface, Makima seems to be a nice, gentle, social and friendly woman, she is seen almost the entire time wearing a smile on her face and acts relaxed and confident even during a crisis, speaking in a professional tone to her workers. As her natural appearance is nearly identical to that of a human, she avoids disclosing her Devil nature to most of her underlings, and spends much of the series posing as a human contracted to a Devil rather than a Devil herself. However, this is only a façade that she uses to fulfill her ultimate goal: After the death of Aki Hayakawa, Makima begins to reveal her true colors to Denji. Makima's true face is of someone that is Machiavellian, calculating, who sees people around her as nothing more than dogs she can use as she much as she likes and must obey her without any hesitation.

						Makima has demonstrated to be extremely cunning, cold and manipulative. She controls Denji through the promises of a romantic and sexual relationship while also threatening him with extermination if he disobeys her. Ruthless and normally dispassionate, she will do whatever it takes to reach her goals, even at the cost of the people she should be protecting. " class="gallery__link">
